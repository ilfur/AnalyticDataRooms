Final NOTES:

Please wait about 2 Minutes for the database to be completely up and loaded.

You can already try out Your sqlplus command line by using this URL in Your browser:
https://var{{ .Values.netzwerk.suffix }}/sqlplus/{{ .Release.Name }}/vnc.html

Alternatively, have a look at Your personal jupyter notebook:
https://var{{ .Values.netzwerk.suffix }}/jupyter/{{ .Release.Name }}/
Just enter the password "vector" when asked and look into Your "work" directory for more.

Once the PDB is ready, You can access it through sqldeveloper-web:
https://dbactions{{ .Values.netzwerk.suffix }}/ords/{{ .Release.Name }}/vector/_sdw/
Just type in user "vector" and password "vector" for the login.

Have fun !
