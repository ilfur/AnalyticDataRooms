Final NOTES:

The graph server is pointing to this database:
{{ .Values.database.connection }}

When entering a database user and password, please be aware that this database user must have the GRAPH_DEVELOPER role granted plus standard roles to connect and select data.

{{- if eq .Values.services.external.type "none" }}
You decided not to have an ingress or virtualservice configured.
So currently, Your graph server and jupyter are reachable only from within the kubernetes cluster, using these names and ports:
{{- if ne .Values.services.internal.graph.ssl "off" }}
          https://{{ include "graph_server.fullname" . }}-svc:7007
{{- else }}
          http://{{ include "graph_server.fullname" . }}-svc:7007
{{- end }}
{{- if ne .Values.services.internal.jupyter.ssl "off" }}
          https://{{ include "graph_server.fullname" . }}-jup-svc:8080
{{- else }}
          http://{{ include "graph_server.fullname" . }}-jup-svc:8080
{{- end }}


{{- else  }}
You should be able to reach Your graph server through this external URL:
https://graph.{{ .Values.services.external.suffix }}/dash/

The Jupyter container should be reachable through this similar URL:
https://graph.{{ .Values.services.external.suffix }}/jupyter/
{{- end  }}

The Jupyter container uses environment variables JDBC_URL and GRAPH_URL, pointing to the database and the graph server:

JDBC_URL={{ .Values.database.connection }}
GRAPH_URL={{- if ne .Values.services.internal.graph.ssl "off" }}
          https://graph.{{ .Values.services.external.suffix }}
{{- else }}
          http://{{ include "graph_server.fullname" . }}-svc:7007
{{- end }}


In jupyter, the Oracle instant client and sqlplus are preinstalled, so You can open a shell in the Jupyter UI
and try to connect to Your database with sqlplus too: 
(Menu File-> New -> Terminal)
Then, in the terminal, cd into the directory /home/jovyan/.jupyter/instantclient_23_6
and run ./sqlplus

Have fun !
